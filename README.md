# I-l-Inspector
This website checks a strings and returns 2 results, a result that transfers all uppercase I's too lowercase, and all lowercase L's too uppercase. The second result is the characters replaced by prompted emoji's for easier viewing. The reason I made this website is in lots of fonts across the web it is hard too tell if it is a uppercase I or a lowercase L. (il), I ran into this problem when trying too enter a password that I was reading off of my phone. I couldn't tell if it was a I or a l, that prompted me to make this website.
